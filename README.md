## 🎧 **Presentation: Online Radio Player Web App**

**Languages Used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with Web Audio API)


### 🟦 **General Overview**
This web application provides an **interactive platform for listening to online radio stations** directly from your browser — no external apps needed.
The interface is modern, fluid, and includes dynamic visual effects and a real-time audio visualizer.


### 🌈 **Visual Design**
* **Animated background** – a moving gradient creates an energetic, modern atmosphere.
* **Clean, responsive design** – all elements are centered and styled with shadows, rounded corners, and transparency.
* **CSS animations** – the title performs a 3D “coin flip” rotation, and the station name fades in smoothly when changed.
* **Interactive buttons** – each button reacts visually on hover and click with light and depth effects.


### 🎛️ **Interactive Features**
* **Quick station switching:**
  The “⏮ Previous Radio” and “Next Radio ⏭” buttons let users browse through available stations easily.
* **Playback control:**
  Users can seek backward or forward by 10 seconds.
* **Dynamic station list:**
  The list of stations is generated automatically, and users can switch stations with a single click.
* **Current station display:**
  The app updates the station name in real time and highlights the active one in the list.


### 🔊 **Real-Time Audio Visualization**
Using the **Web Audio API**, the app draws an **audio waveform visualizer (oscilloscope)** on a `<canvas>` element that moves with the music in real time.
This transforms the listening experience into something both **visual and interactive**, similar to what professional music players offer.


### 🧠 **Technologies Used**
* **HTML5** – for structure and the `<audio>` playback element
* **CSS3** – for styling, gradients, and animations
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – for logic, station management, and audio processing
* **Web Audio API** – for waveform visualization and live rendering


### 📻 **Available Stations**
The app includes a curated selection of popular Romanian and international radio stations, such as:
* Pro FM
* Digi FM
* Radio Paradise
* SomaFM (various channels)
* Radio Hot
* Radio Intens (traditional music)


### 🧩 **Additional Features**
* **GitHub integration** – a direct, elegant link to the author’s GitHub profile.
* **Subtle hover effects** – for icons and links to create smooth user feedback.
* **Browser-friendly audio context handling** – ensures playback works properly even with modern browser security policies that restrict autoplay.


### 💡 **Project Purpose**
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **modern web technologies** — design, animation, and interactivity — can work together to create a fully functional, elegant, and user-friendly multimedia experience.
It serves as both an **educational and practical example** of how to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-world applications.


### 🏁 **Conclusion**
The *“Online Radio Player”* project is a great example of creative front-end development.
It merges **modern aesthetics**, **smooth interactivity**, and **audio technology** into a single, enjoyable user experience — all within one HTML file.
